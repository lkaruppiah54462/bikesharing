##A. Backgroud

New York City has successfully deployed a bike share program that serves its population and visitors.
Also this program has attracted more tourist to the area. Des Moines attracts **13.7 million visitors** 
or **67 times** the population of the city. The tourist spend **$838 million / year**.
By using the latest technologies , a viable similar bike program can be implemented and operated in Des Moines.

##B. New York City

New York City has implemented a very effective and efficient bike share program to serve both its population and tourists.
The data from New York City shows high ridership in the months in summer throughour the day. About ~60% of the riders are males.
Greater than 2 million rides in the month of August. 


##C. New York City and Des Moines

1. Number of visitors /resident is about 67 :1 in Des Moines compared to 7:1 in New York City(NYC)

2. Male ration in Des Moines is slightly higher at 50% compared to 48% in NYC. Data for tourist not available.

3. Physically fit population tend to use the program more and this is also favorable for Des Moines.81% vs 79% of the population 
are between 5 to 65. Vistor data not available.

4. Des Moines has more McDonalds per unit population.  Population density is lower in Des Moines (2000 per sq.mile )
compared to 27k per sq mile for NYC. In general , anticipate the rides to be longer and some form of easy and low cost 
transporation will help the tourists/residents.

##D. Data/Assumption
1. We obtainned data from the census breau and tourist web sites.

2. Difficult to get visitor data broken down by gender and age

3. Assumed resident distribution of geneder and age to apply to visitors.

##E. Recommendation
1.  Definitely a shared Bike Program will ease the current shortages in helping the touist to cover the attractions of Des Moines.

2. Recommend to implement a pilot program to see the effectiveness and benefits of the program and its business model.

3. On prove of concept in Des Moines , implement across the city and also expand to othe cities with similar needs.
